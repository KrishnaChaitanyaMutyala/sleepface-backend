- **Face detection confidence** based on landmark distribution
- **Feature consistency** analysis to detect outliers
- **Weighted overall confidence** scoring (0.0 to 1.0)

### 4. Enhanced Scoring Algorithms
- **Adaptive scoring** with 60% facial features, 30% lifestyle, 10% correlation
- **Enhanced lifestyle integration** with non-linear curves for sleep and hydration
- **Comprehensive skincare product scoring** with ingredient-specific bonuses
- **Feature correlation analysis** for sleep and skin health patterns
- **Additional lifestyle factors**: screen time, alcohol, exercise, stress

### 5. Enhanced Recommendation Engine
- **Comprehensive insights** for all 6 features with specific thresholds
- **Prioritized recommendations**: urgent, daily, and preventive care
